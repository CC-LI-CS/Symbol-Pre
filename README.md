# Symbol-based multilevel block $\tau$ preconditioners for multilevel block Toeplitz systems: GLT-based analysis and applications
The examples EX1 & EX2 referenced in this document are derived from the article "Preconditioners for Symmetrized Toeplitz and Multilevel Toeplitz Matrices" by Pestana. Special thanks to Pestana for openly sharing the associated code, which is available at [jpestana/fracdiff.](https://github.com/jpestana/fracdiff)
