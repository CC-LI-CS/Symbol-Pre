# Symbol-based multilevel block $\tau$ preconditioners for multilevel block Toeplitz systems: GLT-based analysis and applications
The examples EX1 and EX2 in this document are largely derived from the numerical examples in the paper Preconditioners for Symmetric Toeplitz and Multilevel Toeplitz Matrices (2019) by Pestana. The associated MATLAB code is publicly available at [jpestana/fracdiff.](https://github.com/jpestana/fracdiff)
